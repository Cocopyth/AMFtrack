## Setup for Linux

### Setting up environment

From base folder:
```
virtualenv --python=python3 venv
```
(or replace `python3` by the path to the python version you want to clone.)

Launching environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install requiered packages

Activate the environnement before launching

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Additionnal packages to install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gattia/cycpd
cd cycpd
sudo python setup.py install
```

Install Fiji:

Chose a location on the computer and download:
https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads

Install anisotropic filtering:

Chose a location on the computer and download:
http://forge.cbp.ens-lyon.fr/redmine/projects/anifilters

### Install the package in editable mode

For better display:

`jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`
`jupyter lab build`

### Install the package in editable mode
Remove the *pyproject.toml* file (for poetry)

To run from the base folder:
(will run the setup.py script)
`pip install -e .`

### Local.env file

Create a text file named `local.env` in the base folder
(for example: `touch local.env`)

And fill the file with the following lines and adapt them to your situation:

```
DATA_PATH=/home/cbisot/pycode/data_info.json
FIJI_PATH=/home/cbisot/Fiji.app/ImageJ-linux64
TEMP_PATH=/scratch-shared/amftrack/temp #careful no backslash here
STORAGE_PATH=/scratch-shared/amftrack/temp #careful no backslash here
PASTIS_PATH=/home/cbisot/anis_filter/anifilters/bin/ani2D 
#the path to the executable of anisotropic filtering
SLURM_PATH=/scratch-shared/amftrack/slurm #this is for parallelizez job on snellius

#For Dropbox transfers, ask dropbox admin for these values
APP_KEY=___
APP_SECRET=___
REFRESH_TOKEN = ___
FOLDER_ID=___
USER_ID=___
```

To have access to a path: 
Always import from the util.sys

# Presentation of the repository
## Logging
### Intro
For logging, the logging module `logging` enables to add logging messages across code and set the level of verbosity.
There are 4 levels of verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR). Each log line is of one of this types.
Examples: 
```python
logger.info("Processing is done")
logger.warning("Couldn't handle all cases")
```
### 1/ Adding logging to a file
To add logging to a file we use:

``` python
import logging
import os
logger = logging.getLogger(os.path.basename(__file__))
```
This creates a logger with the name of the file.
### 2/ Setting log level
- The general log level (verbosity) can be set in the general \_\_init\_\_.py file.
By changing the line
```
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO, format=log_format)
```

- A filter can also be added to change log level from a specific files or from a specific module.
```
some_logger = logging.getLogger("name_of_the_file")
some_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

- The log level can also be changed directly in a file with:
```python
logger.setLevel("INFO")
```

### 3/ Remarks

In a certain file, `logging.info("something")` will also work but will display "root" as the name of the logger and not the name of the file that issued the log

## Tests

### 1/ Generality
The tests are all in the `test` folder.
The python module chosen for tests is `unittest`.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

All test files must start with `test`. All test function and classes must start with `test`.

**Ex**: `test_sys_util.py`

And all testing classes must be subclass from the unittest base test class and must start with Test.

The file **helper.py** contains utils for testing: mock object, skipping functions, ..

### 2/ Launching tests
Tests can be launched with the following command:
```
python3 -m unittest discover . "test*.py"
```

Runing only one test:
```
python3 -m unittest -v ~/Wks/AMFtrack/test/util/test_geometry.py
```

Test can also be run with `pytest` if installed (prettier display)
```bash
pytest test_file.py -k test_function
```

### 3/ Special tests
For some tests, a processed Prince plate is required. Or other types of files.
The data file must be stored at the following path:
**storage_path** + "**test**".
If the data is not present, the tests will be skipped.
The tests can be safely run even if to test/ directory is present.

Some tests create and save plots in the **test** directory.
These files don't accumulate (they are just replace at each test).

### 4/ Getting test coverage
The coverage gives an idea of the portion of code which is covered by the tests.

Getting test coverage:
`coverage run -m unittest discover`
`coverage report -m`
(https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.2/)


## Coordinates

The general choice of coordinates is:
x -> for the small vertical axis (3000 for prince images)
y -> for the long horizontal axis

This choice is consistent accross `general`, `timestep` and `image` referential in the `exp` object.
As a result:
- we write coordinates as `[x, y]`
- np.arrays have the shape (dim_x, dim_y) and can be shown with plt.imshow()
- to access a coordinate in an image we use `im[x][y]`

CAREFUL: the following coordinate usage have a different convention:
- coordinates with Loreto microscope joystick: x and y are inversed (x is for the long horizontal axis)
- image coordinates in the fiji tile file: x and y are inversed (x is for the long horizontal axis)
- plt.plot() uses a different convention. We will always have to inverse coordinates when using plt.plot
Ex: plt.plot(x[1], x[0], ..)
- cv.resize takes the shape reversed compared to numpy
- labelme also uses inversed x and y
